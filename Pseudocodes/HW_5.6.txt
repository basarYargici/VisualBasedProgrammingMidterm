HW_5.6 Pseudocode:


-Pythagorean triples rules:
-- side1 or side2 or hypotenuse can not be bigger than upper limit 
-- side1^2 + side2^2 = hypotenuse^2 (from Pythagorean theorem)


- We should indicate upper limit of a side can get
- We should try all possibilities to get all Pythagorean triples in a given range. That can be provided with nested "for"s as author want us. 
In the last "for" body, we can check Pythagorean theorem and decide if sides provide the rules.
